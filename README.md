# React Portfolio
## Author: [Sylvester Assiamah] - Module 20

## Description

This webpage serves as my personal portfolio, built using React. It is designed to showcase my projects, skills, and contact information in a professional and appealing manner. The portfolio is organized into different sections such as About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, each of which can be accessed through a responsive navigation bar. The code is modular and clean, with comments added to enhance understanding and maintainability.
